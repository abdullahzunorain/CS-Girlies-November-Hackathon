## 🎯 Project Overview

Turn studying into a fun, Y2K-inspired game where AI-generated flashcards, XP, and customizable avatars make learning addictive and effective.

### The Problem
Students often struggle with staying motivated and engaged while studying:  
- Traditional study methods feel boring and repetitive  
- It’s hard to track progress and measure improvement  
- Current learning apps lack gamification and personalization  


### Our Solution 
StudyBratz gamifies learning with a Bratz-inspired avatar system:  
- AI generates flashcards from user-selected topics or uploaded notes  
- Students earn XP and level up by completing study sessions  
- Unlock study powers (Pomodoro, Feynman, Active Recall, Spaced Repetition) and customize your avatar and virtual room  

### Why This Matters 
By combining gamification with proven learning strategies, StudyBratz keeps students engaged, helps them retain knowledge more effectively, and makes learning enjoyable for any subject, from Biology to Languages.
