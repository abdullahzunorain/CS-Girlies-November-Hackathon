## 🧠 Inspiration

[Why did you build this? What problem inspired you?]

Example:
"As students ourselves, we've experienced the struggle of trying to stay 
engaged while studying. Traditional flashcards are boring, and manually 
creating quizzes takes hours. We wanted to build something that makes 
learning feel less like a chore and more like an adventure."

---

## 🎯 What it does

[Clearly explain your project's functionality - be specific!]

Example:
"[Project Name] is an AI-powered learning companion that:

✨ **Auto-generates quizzes** from any text input (notes, textbooks, articles)
✨ **Creates personalized flashcards** tailored to your learning style
✨ **Tracks your progress** and adapts difficulty in real-time
✨ **Provides instant feedback** with detailed explanations
✨ **Gamifies learning** with points, streaks, and achievements

Simply paste your study material, and our AI transforms it into 
interactive learning content in seconds."

---

## 🛠️ How we built it

[Technical details - show you know your stuff!]

Example:
"We built [Project Name] using a modern tech stack:

**Frontend:**
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript for a clean, responsive interface
- Vanilla JS for lightweight, fast interactions
- Custom CSS animations for engaging UX

**Backend:**
- Python Flask for API endpoints
- RESTful architecture for scalability
- CORS-enabled for frontend communication

**AI Integration:**
- OpenAI GPT-4 API for natural language processing
- Custom prompts optimized for educational content
- Token optimization to reduce costs

**Development Tools:**
- Git/GitHub for version control
- VS Code as our IDE
- [Cline CLI for rapid deployment] ← if applicable
- GitBook for professional documentation ← if applicable

We used Agile methodology with 4-hour sprints throughout the 48 hours."

---

## 🚧 Challenges we ran into

[Be honest - judges appreciate authenticity!]

Example:
"**Challenge 1: AI Prompt Engineering**
Getting consistent, high-quality quiz questions from GPT required extensive 
prompt testing. We iterated through 20+ prompt variations before finding 
the right balance.

**Challenge 2: Rate Limiting**
During testing, we hit OpenAI's rate limits. We implemented caching and 
request batching to optimize API usage.

**Challenge 3: Time Constraints**
Balancing feature development with documentation and video creation in 
48 hours was intense. We prioritized core functionality first, then 
polished the UX.

**Challenge 4: Cross-browser Compatibility**
Our CSS animations broke in Safari. We spent 3 hours debugging before 
finding a cross-platform solution."

---

## 🎉 Accomplishments that we're proud of

[Celebrate your wins!]

Example:
"✅ **Built a fully functional MVP in 48 hours** with zero prior experience 
   working together as a team

✅ **Achieved <2 second response times** for AI processing through optimization

✅ **Created professional documentation** using GitBook with API references, 
   architecture diagrams, and setup guides

✅ **Designed an accessible, mobile-friendly interface** that works across 
   all devices

✅ **Generated 100+ test questions** with 95%+ accuracy during QA testing

✅ **Learned new technologies** (OpenAI API, Flask) during the hackathon"
